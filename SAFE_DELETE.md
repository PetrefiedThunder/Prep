# SAFE_DELETE Manifest

This document enumerates directories/files removed by this PR and why it is safe.

## Summary
- Total deletions: ~55,122 LOC
- Objective: Retire legacy marketplace code and duplicated scaffolds in favor of the Enterprise Orchestration Platform.

## Categories

### 1) Deprecated Marketplace / Legacy Services
- **Removed:** `prepchef/*`, older marketplace handlers, unused API routes
- **Reason:** Replaced by orchestration layer + modular compliance engines
- **Risk:** Low — superseded functionality, no longer referenced by imports or CI.

### 2) Generated / Build Artifacts
- **Removed:** `dist/*`, cache and artifact folders
- **Reason:** Re-generated by builds; checked in by mistake
- **Risk:** None — reproducible from source.

### 3) Duplicated Frontend Scaffolds
- **Removed:** Old `apps/*` variants not used by HarborHomes or current UI
- **Reason:** Consolidation under the new app surface
- **Risk:** Medium — validate that Vercel is re-pointed or disabled.

### 4) Dead Tests and Migrations
- **Removed:** Tests tied to retired modules, stale migration files
- **Reason:** Prevents failing CI due to orphaned imports
- **Risk:** Low — new smoke test validates orchestration.

## Validation Checklist
- [x] `pip install -e .[dev]` succeeds
- [x] `pytest -q` passes (SQLite via GUID adapter)
- [x] Orchestration smoke test green
- [x] CI restored via `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`
- [x] Vercel either configured to current app or disabled

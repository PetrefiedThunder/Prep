# Platform Growth Roadmap

This roadmap assumes Prep has completed Phase 1 delivery (federal + city compliance layers, onboarding foundation) and is preparing for the next 12 months. It prioritizes **scale**, **monetization**, and **enterprise integrations** while maintaining regulatory credibility.

---

## Guiding Principles
- **Operational reliability first:** Zero downtime compliance checks and nightly refresh SLAs.
- **Revenue expansion:** Layer monetization experiments without compromising trust.
- **Enterprise readiness:** SOC 2 posture, auditability, and API guarantees.
- **Modular delivery:** Each initiative ships as a production-ready slice with GTM collateral.

---

## 0-3 Months (Scale Foundations)
- **Infrastructure Hardening**
  - Multi-region deployment for regulatory services (`apps/*_regulatory_service`)
  - Global read replicas for `prep_core` Postgres + Redis Cluster.
  - Incident response automation (pager rotation, runbook updates in `RUNBOOK.md`).
- **Data Quality Ops**
  - Launch automated diffing between federal/state/city datasets (`jobs/data_diff_report.py`).
  - Add QA workflows in GitHub (`.github/workflows/compliance-data-ci.yml`).
- **Usage Analytics**
  - Instrument compliance checks with Segment/Amplitude (telemetry in `prep/telemetry/`).
  - Define success dashboards in `grafana/dashboards/compliance_ops.json`.
- **Hiring & Teaming**
  - Add first SRE + Data QA roles; update `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md` with state-layer procedures.

**Key Metrics:** 99.9% API uptime, <4h MTTR, ≥95% data freshness compliance.

---

## 3-6 Months (Monetization Experiments)
- **Pricing & Packaging**
  - Launch tiered compliance subscriptions (`pricing-service/`) with state add-ons.
  - Integrate metered billing events into Stripe via `services/billing_webhooks/`.
- **Premium Features**
  - Real-time compliance alerts (web + SMS) using `apps/notification_service/`.
  - Evidence vault exports to auditors (PDF + JSON) in `prep/reporting/`.
- **Marketplace Plays**
  - Partner onboarding APIs for kitchen marketplaces (`integrations/marketplaces/`).
  - Co-marketing assets stored in `docs/gtm/`.
- **Trust Signals**
  - SOC 2 Type I audit readiness (policies in `SECURITY.md`, controls tracked in `security_audit.log`).

**Key Metrics:** +40% ARPU, 20% attachment rate for state modules, SOC 2 Type I complete.

---

## 6-12 Months (Enterprise Integrations & Expansion)
- **National Footprint**
  - Roll out additional high-priority states (Texas, Florida, Illinois) using California blueprint.
  - Introduce multi-tenant support in `prep/core/tenanting.py` for national chains.
- **Enterprise Integrations**
  - ERP integrations (Oracle NetSuite, SAP) via `integrations/erp/` connectors.
  - HRIS sync (Workday, Rippling) for food handler credential monitoring.
  - SSO + SCIM in `services/auth/enterprise/`.
- **Advanced Automation**
  - Risk scoring ML pipeline in `modules/risk_engine/` with feature store.
  - Predictive renewal reminders integrated with `apps/notification_service/`.
- **Governance & Compliance**
  - SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 pursuit (evidence tracked in `docs/compliance/audit/`).
  - Continuous penetration testing cadence (`security_weekly_check.sh`).

**Key Metrics:** 5 enterprise logos, <1h compliance drift detection, SOC 2 Type II underway.

---

## Cross-Cutting Initiatives
- **Customer Success:** Build playbooks in `docs/customer_success/` for onboarding, QBRs, and renewal workflows.
- **Product Marketing:** Launch quarterly "Prep Compliance Pulse" reports leveraging aggregated insights.
- **Community & Advocacy:** Engage with California Retail Food Safety Coalition and similar bodies in expansion states.

---

## Dependencies & Risks
- Regulatory updates may outpace ETL cadences → mitigate with manual override workflows (`apps/compliance_admin/`).
- Enterprise deals require custom data processing agreements → coordinate with legal updates in `PRIVACY.md` & `TERMS.md`.
- Monetization experiments need tight analytics instrumentation to avoid revenue leakage.

---

## Next Steps
1. Socialize roadmap with leadership and stakeholders.
2. Convert initiatives into project management epics referencing the outlined directories.
3. Establish quarterly OKRs aligned to metrics listed above.
4. Kick off state expansion implementation as the first growth block.

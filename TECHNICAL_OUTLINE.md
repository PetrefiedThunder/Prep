# Technical Outline

## Privacy-First Data Layer Specification

This section describes a data model and handling approach that embeds privacy-by-design principles.

### Data Minimization
- Collect only essential fields required for the service (e.g., user email, hashed password, optional profile info).
- All optional metadata must have explicit user consent before storage.

### Data Segregation
- Separate PII from usage metrics to reduce exposure.
- Use role-based access controls to restrict who can query or export sensitive data.

### Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive columns at rest and enforce TLS for data in transit.
- Rotate encryption keys periodically and maintain an audit trail of key rotations.

### Access Logging
- Record all administrative and privileged data access.
- Maintain logs for 30 days and rotate per GDPR requirements.

### Deletion & Export APIs
- Implement `/user/delete` for account removal (soft delete followed by scheduled purge).
- Provide `/user/data-export` for user-accessible copies of their personal data in a portable format.

### Third-Party Integrations
- Use scoped tokens for external vendors (payment processors, email providers).
- Review vendor compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001) before transmitting PII.

# Prep Integration Audit

## Overview
The Prep repository contains several modular services that expose logging, safety
monitoring, haptic feedback, and coaching utilities. Prior to this change the
modules operated independently, making it difficult to orchestrate cross-module
workflows or capture structured data that downstream systems require.

## Key Findings
- **Limited event context** – `PrepSyncAgent.log_event` accepted only string
  values and offered no way to include structured metadata. This made it hard to
  enrich sensor logs with severity, source, or correlation identifiers needed by
  downstream integrations.
- **Safety daemon isolation** – `SafetyDaemon.monitor` logged its activity but
  provided no hooks for other systems to react. Integrations like alerting,
  telemetry, or escalations had to poll logs instead of receiving structured
  callbacks.
- **Missing orchestration layer** – There was no first-class place to coordinate
  actions across `PrepSyncAgent`, `VoiceCoach`, and `HapticRouter`, so code that
  needed to log an event, speak to the user, and trigger haptics had to be
  hand-written in every caller.

## Implemented Fixes
- Extended `PrepSyncAgent.log_event` to accept any value and optional metadata,
  automatically serialising unhandled types. This makes it straightforward to
  attach integration specific context to each event.
- Added an optional event handler to `SafetyDaemon` that supports synchronous or
  asynchronous callbacks. The daemon now informs integrations whenever a safety
  check occurs.
- Introduced an `IntegrationCoordinator` that wires the logging, voice coaching,
  and haptic routing modules together. The coordinator exposes helpers to
  broadcast alerts and to connect the safety daemon so that safety checks can be
  escalated through all feedback channels consistently.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Persist the coordinator outputs to an integration queue (e.g. Kafka or AWS
  SNS) so that downstream services can consume the structured events in real
  time.
- Extend the coordinator to support acknowledgement workflows so that hosts can
  confirm alerts via the voice or haptic interfaces.
- Provide adapters for third-party APIs (e.g. Twilio or PagerDuty) that can be
  invoked from the coordinator metadata to close the loop between automated
  detection and human intervention.

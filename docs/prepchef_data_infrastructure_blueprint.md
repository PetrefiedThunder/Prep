# PrepChef Data Infrastructure Blueprint

## Overview

This document translates the PrepChef regulatory intelligence plan into an execution-ready roadmap focused on building a national food safety compliance network without upfront infrastructure spending.

## Phase 1 — API Discovery & Cataloging (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Launch an automated, continuously refreshed inventory of county-level food safety data endpoints.

- **Implementation stack:** Airtable for rapid tagging, Supabase for structured storage, GitHub Actions for version-controlled sync.
- **Automation:** n8n or Make scenarios that sweep known OpenGov, Socrata, and ArcGIS directories and push deltas into Supabase nightly.
- **Data model:** Records store county metadata, endpoint URLs, platform type, schema references, auth method, refresh cadence, and rolling data quality score as JSON for immediate ingestion.
- **Deliverable:** Dynamic API Catalog with ≥300 counties indexed and freshness scoring by end of Week 2.
- **Schema assets:** Supabase-ready SQL migration (`prepchef/db/phase1_api_catalog_schema.sql`) and ingestion payload template (`prepchef/db/phase1_ingestion_template.json`) to seed the catalog and automate discovery workflows.

## Phase 2 — Gap Analysis & Partnerships (Weeks 3–4)

**Goal:** Convert the catalog into outreach momentum to secure data sharing for the remaining counties.

- **Outreach engine:** Airtable-anchored CRM connected to Mailmeteor or YAMM for personalized open data requests; auto-log response sentiment for reporting.
- **Partnerships:** Coordinate with NACCHO, state environmental health associations, and Code for America brigades; reserve FOIA requests for last-mile jurisdictions (<10%).
- **Deliverable:** Data Partnership CRM with ≥20 counties engaged and partnership status tracked as an investor-facing traction metric.

## Phase 3 — Technical Architecture (Weeks 5–6)

**Goal:** Stand up the core ingestion and serving layer using open-source tooling.

- **Stack alignment:** Airbyte or Apache NiFi for low-code ETL into Supabase; PostgREST for instant REST endpoints; Grafana Cloud (free tier) or UptimeRobot for baseline monitoring.
- **Schema governance:** Publish `prepchef_foodsafety_schema_v1.yaml` aligning with FHIR, USDA, and NACCHO environmental health recommendations in a public GitHub repository.
- **Deliverable:** PrepChef Data Layer v1 with 95% ingestion success across the first 10 pilot counties.

## Phase 4 — Pilot & Iteration (Weeks 7–8)

**Goal:** Demonstrate value through a multi-county live pilot.

- **Pilot mix:** LA County (Socrata), Cook County (OpenGov), King County (ArcGIS), Maricopa County (custom API), Palm Beach County (manual ingest).
- **Narrative outputs:** National Kitchen Compliance Map hosted on prepchef.io and a Retool or Grafana dashboard visualizing coverage and data freshness.
- **Deliverable:** PrepChef Data Transparency Dashboard publicly accessible for investor and civic partner demos.

## Phase 5 — Legal & Policy Integration (Weeks 9–10)

**Goal:** Ensure compliance readiness for government partnerships.

- Align data handling with CDC and FDA guidance and produce a universal Data Use & Compliance Policy.
- Integrate with the Prep Legislative Intelligence Core (PLIC) to track regulatory updates.
- **Deliverable:** Published compliance documentation set and live regulatory monitoring feed.

## Phase 6 — Monetization & Expansion (Weeks 11–12)

**Goal:** Package the platform for revenue-generating integrations.

- Launch an API-as-a-Service offering for third-party platforms (delivery apps, POS providers, insurers).
- Prototype partner pilots with Toast, DoorDash/Uber Eats, and local business improvement districts using Stripe test mode for payments.
- **Deliverable:** Revenue simulation and partner pilot plan validated through initial integrations.

## Phase-Based Summary

| Phase | Core Output                    | Tooling Highlights                         | KPI Focus                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1     | Dynamic API Catalog            | Supabase, Airtable, GitHub Actions, n8n    | ≥300 counties indexed         |
| 2     | Data Partnership CRM           | Airtable CRM, Mailmeteor/YAMM              | ≥20 active engagements        |
| 3     | PrepChef Data Layer v1         | Airbyte/NiFi, PostgREST, Grafana           | 95% ingestion reliability     |
| 4     | Transparency Dashboard         | Retool/Grafana, Mapbox, Supabase           | Public pilot dashboard online |
| 5     | Compliance Documentation Suite | PLIC integration, GitHub Pages publishing  | Legal readiness established   |
| 6     | API-as-a-Service Pilot         | Stripe test mode, partner integrations     | Revenue simulation readiness  |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Approve the migration to the Supabase + Airtable hybrid catalog and instantiate the base tables.
2. Initialize a GitHub repository to host the schema YAML and ingestion automation scripts.
3. Select the first 10 pilot counties and run discovery to populate endpoint metadata.
4. Connect the Prep Legislative Intelligence Core to supply regulatory update feeds.
5. Publish the public-facing dashboard once the initial pilot data is available.

# Codex Execution Pattern

This document captures the current end-to-end execution approach for the Codex program.

## Phase Breakdown and Versioning

| Phase Range | Version Tag | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Phases 1–2  | v0.9        | Foundation build-out and early validation.
| Phases 3–4  | v1.0        | General availability launch milestones.
| Phase 5     | v1.1        | Enterprise-focused release items.

## Parallel Job Categories

Within each phase, run tasks in parallel by operational category:

- **Point of Sale (POS)**
- **Inventory**
- **Delivery**

This allows the respective workstreams to progress concurrently while aligning on shared phase goals.

## Verification Loop

After completing the work within a phase, execute the verification loop in the following order:

1. `codex.test_all()`
2. `codex.deploy_staging()`
3. `codex.monitor_metrics()`

## Failure Recovery

If the verification loop yields a test pass rate below 95%, immediately roll back to the previous checkpoint and remediate before proceeding.

# Phase 19: Module Overview and Compliance Planning

## Purpose and Key Features of Each Module

- **Data Ingestion**: Collects and validates payroll data from multiple sources. Handles schema normalization and basic error checking.
- **Payroll Processing**: Applies business rules to calculate pay, deductions, and benefits. Supports custom rule plug-ins.
- **Reporting**: Generates standard payroll reports and exports data for third-party services.
- **User Management**: Handles authentication and permission levels for payroll administrators and employees.

## Planned Integrations and Compliance

- **IRS**: Automate form submission and tax withholding updates.
- **DOL**: Provide reporting for wage and hour compliance.
- **GDPR**: Ensure data retention and deletion policies follow European privacy regulations.
- Additional integrations may include state-specific tax agencies and benefits providers.

## High-Level Development and Testing Sequence

1. Design database schema and set up development environment.
2. Implement core modules and internal APIs.
3. Integrate IRS and DOL endpoints in a sandbox environment.
4. Add GDPR compliance checks and data governance tools.
5. Conduct unit and integration testing across modules.
6. Perform user acceptance testing with sample payroll data.
